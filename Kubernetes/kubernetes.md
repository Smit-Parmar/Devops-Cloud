**Pods**
- Pod is the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model. It represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster and encapsulates one or more containerized applications.

    ***Containerization***: A Pod can encapsulate one or more containers, which are tightly coupled and share the same network namespace. Containers within a Pod can communicate with each other using localhost and share the same storage volumes.

    **Shared Resources**: Containers within a Pod share the same network namespace, allowing them to communicate with each other using localhost. They also share the same storage volumes, making it easy for them to share data.

**ReplicaSet**
- ReplicaSet is a controller that ensures a specified number of replicas (identical copies) of a pod are running at all times. It is part of the broader concept of controllers within the Kubernetes architecture.

**Deployement**
- Deployment is a higher-level abstraction that provides a declarative way to manage the deployment of applications. It ensures that a specified number of instances of your application (pods) are running and provides mechanisms for updating these instances to new versions.

    ***Automatic Scaling***: Deployments support automatic scaling of pods based on the specified replica count. If a pod fails or is terminated, the Deployment controller automatically creates a new pod to maintain the desired number of replicas.

    ***Rolling Updates and Rollbacks***: Deployments support rolling updates, allowing you to update your application without downtime. You can change the container image or update other specifications, and the Deployment controller will gradually replace old pods with new ones. If an update causes issues, you can easily rollback to a previous version.

**Definition file**
```bash
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp-container
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

- **apiVersion**: Specifies the Kubernetes API version to use. In this case, it's `apps/v1`, indicating the apps group and the v1 version.

- **kind**: Specifies the type of Kubernetes resource being defined. Here, it's a `Deployment`.

- **metadata**: Contains metadata for the deployment, including the name (`myapp-deployment`).

- **spec**: Describes the desired state of the deployment.

  - **replicas**: Specifies the desired number of replicas (instances) of the application. In this example, it's set to `3`.

  - **selector**: Defines how the deployment identifies the pods it manages. In this case, it matches pods with the label `app: myapp`.

  - **template**: Specifies the pod template used to create new pods.

    - **metadata**: Contains labels applied to pods created from this template.

    - **spec**: Describes the pod's specification.

      - **containers**: Specifies the containers to run in the pod.

        - **name**: The name of the container (`myapp-container`).

        - **image**: The container image to use (`nginx:latest`).

        - **ports**: Defines the ports the container exposes.

          - **containerPort**: Specifies the port on which the container is listening (`80`).

This YAML file, when applied using `kubectl apply -f filename.yaml`, instructs Kubernetes to create a Deployment named `myapp-deployment` with three replicas. Each replica is a pod running an Nginx container, and the pods are labeled with `app: myapp`.


**Difference between ReplicaSet and Deployment**
- ReplicaSet is more focused on maintaining a specified number of replicas, a Deployment is a higher-level controller that adds features for declarative updates, rolling updates, and rollbacks, making it more suitable for managing the deployment lifecycle of applications in Kubernetes. Deployments are often recommended for deploying and managing applications in a production environment.

**Service**
- In Kubernetes, a Service is a method for exposing a network application that is running as one or more Pods in your cluster.

***NodePort Service:***
- A NodePort Service exposes a service on each node's IP address at a static port. This makes the service accessible externally from outside the cluster. It's often used during development or testing phases.

When a NodePort Service is created, Kubernetes allocates a specific port on each node, and traffic to that port is forwarded to the service.

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nodeport-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - nodePort: 30080
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: my-app
```
***ClusterIP Service:***
A ClusterIP Service exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP address, and it is only accessible within the cluster.

This type of service is suitable for communication between different components of an application running in the same cluster.
```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-clusterip-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: my-app
```

***Load balancer***
A LoadBalancer Service is used when you want to expose a service to the external world, and the cloud provider provisions a load balancer to distribute traffic to the service.

It is suitable for production environments where you want to ensure high availability and distribute external traffic among multiple nodes.

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-loadbalancer-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: my-app
```
