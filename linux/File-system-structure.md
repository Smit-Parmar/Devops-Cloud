# Linux File and Directory Structure

## High level overview
- ![File System](https://github.com/Smit-Parmar/Devops-Cloud/blob/main/Images/file-system.png)
## Root Directory (/)

- The root directory is the top-level directory in the Linux filesystem hierarchy.
- All other directories and files are organized under this root directory.
- It contains essential system files, configuration files, and subdirectories.

## /bin (Binary Files)

- This directory contains essential system binaries (executable files).
- Binaries required for system recovery and repair are stored here.
- Common commands like `ls`, `cp`, and `mkdir` are located in `/bin`.

## /boot (Boot Files)

- Contains the Linux kernel and bootloader configuration files.
- Essential for the system to boot successfully.

## /dev (Device Files)

- Contains device files representing hardware devices and peripherals.
- These files allow interaction with hardware devices as if they were regular files.
- For example, `/dev/sda` represents the first hard drive.

## /etc (System Configuration)

- Contains system-wide configuration files and scripts.
- Configuration files for software and system settings are stored here.
- Examples include `/etc/network/` for network configuration and `/etc/ssh/` for SSH configuration.

## /home (User Home Directories)

- Home directories for regular users are located here.
- Each user typically has a subdirectory with their username (e.g., `/home/username`).

## /lib (Library Files)

- Contains shared libraries required by system binaries and applications.
- These libraries provide essential functions and resources for software to run.

## /media and /mnt (Mount Points)

- These directories are used as mount points for external devices such as USB drives and network shares.
- When you connect an external device, it is often mounted here for access.

## /opt (Optional Software)

- Contains optional software packages and applications installed manually or by third-party vendors.
- It is not typically used for system software but rather for additional software.

## /srv (Service Data)

- Used for data files related to services provided by the system.
- Web server data, FTP files, and other service data can be placed here.

## /tmp (Temporary Files)

- Temporary files created by applications and users are stored here.
- This directory is often cleaned during system startup.

## /usr (User Binaries and Data)

- Contains user-accessible binaries, libraries, documentation, and other data.
- Similar to `/bin` and `/lib`, but typically larger and containing non-essential software.

## /var (Variable Data)

- Contains variable data such as logs, spool files, and other files that change during system operation.
- Important system logs are stored in `/var/log`.

## /proc (Process Information)

- A virtual filesystem that provides information about running processes and kernel parameters.
- Files and directories in `/proc` allow monitoring and interaction with the kernel and processes.

## /sys (Sysfs Filesystem)

- Another virtual filesystem that exposes information about kernel and hardware to userspace.
- Used for configuring and monitoring the kernel and hardware.

Understanding the Linux filesystem hierarchy is crucial for managing files, configuring the system, and troubleshooting issues. It helps users and administrators locate files and directories efficiently and ensures a consistent structure across Linux distributions, making it easier to develop and maintain software for Linux systems.
